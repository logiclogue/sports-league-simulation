# Sport League Simulation

## Requirements

The scenario is, I want to motivate myself to play better online Chess. Normally
I'm playing against individual players with no context. The only motivation is
to improve my rating. Something I really enjoy watching is the Football League.
Not just playing the game, but in the context of a greater competition.

That's something I want to take these individual online Chess games. I want to
be able to simulate a fictional league of Chess. The leagues must have
promotions and relegations, the other players must have particular identities
and have different strengths.

The system will work off the Elo Chess rating system.

The system will be able to apply to any generic game. Each game will be defined
as a specific result (win/loss) to draw ratio. For example, in Chess you have
far more draws than in Football.
